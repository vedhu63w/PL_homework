Running the interpretor is simple. Do python Interpretor_1.py and then input will continue till $$.

Python 2.7 required

---RUN---
python Interpretor_1.py 
(a.b)$$
or 
python Interpretor_1.py < Input1.txt

output is on standard output

---------Note-----------
The interpretor will ignore everthing after $ in that line
for example
(a.b)$(a
.c)$$
will not work
as "(a" is after $ that is ignored
NOTHING SHOULD BE AFTER $ IN THE SAME LINE
